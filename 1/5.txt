I think that if its applicitive it will spin out because it will try to evaluate y  which it thinks is p the function which just returns or refers to itself?--wrong-ish

it spins out because applicitive-order is trying to evaluate (p) first in the test expression.

Normal order, will never have to expand the p because we're always testing with 0.
